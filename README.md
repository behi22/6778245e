## Usage

The app should have the following features:

- **Activity Feed** - simple list of calls
- **Activity Detail** - detail of a call
- **Archive** - the final user should be able to archive (and unarchive) a call. Archived calls will no longer be displayed on the Activity Feed and should have a separate Archived Tab.
- A button to archive all calls in the activity feed
- A button to unarchive all calls in the archived calls tab

## Project Status

Project is: Semi-Complete (Demo)

## Room for Improvement

- There is an issue currently with deprecation which I didn't have the time to fix in my 48 hours.

- The Footer can be improved to consist of actual buttons with functions instead of icons. I also didn't find time to write helper functions to fix the phone numbers fetched from the API.

## Acknowledgements
